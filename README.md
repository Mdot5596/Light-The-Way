# Light-The-Way
3D Horror Game Built in Unity 

I’m making this game as a way to get back into the swing of things before starting my master’s. Over the summer I didn’t get much time to work on games because of my part-time job, so i am going to try and make this the most polished version i can with the week and a half i have left before returning.
